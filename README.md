# Project 1: Advanced Pandas Project
This project challenges you to clean and enhance the Titanic dataset from Kaggle using Pandas in Google Colab, preparing real-world data for data science and AI tasks. You’ll tackle missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and create a new feature while handling outliers, producing a robust dataset. This hands-on project in the AI RAG Agent MCP Training Plan builds skills for data preparation in visualization or AI modeling.
Handle missing data with imputation or deletion techniques.
Remove duplicates to ensure data integrity.
Standardize formats for consistency and usability.
Engineer features and manage outliers with creative decision-making.
Document cleaning steps for reproducibility.
Messy datasets like Titanic are common, with issues that can skew analyses or AI models. Cleaning and enhancing such datasets ensures reliable insights, a critical skill for workflows like predictive modelling or reporting.

#Project 2: 🚀 Capstone Project: Launch Your Interactive Dashboard! 🌍

Hey there, data explorers! 👋 Get ready for an exciting capstone project where you'll bring your skills to life by building a sleek, interactive dashboard from the ground up. We'll be using the Global Land Temperatures dataset to create a cool web app that lets anyone explore climate trends. Let's get building! 🛠️
Your Tech Toolkit 🧰

We'll be working entirely within a Google Colab notebook, using a powerful set of tools:
🐼 Pandas: For wrangling and cleaning our temperature data.
✨ Streamlit: To magically build our web app's user interface.
📊 Plotly Express: For creating stunning and interactive charts.
🔗 Ngrok: To launch your app onto the web and get a shareable link!
Your Mission Briefing: Step-by-Step 🗺️

You'll follow a clear, step-by-step process to complete the project:Gear Up! ⚙️ First, we'll get your Colab environment ready by installing the necessary Python libraries (streamlit and pyngrok).Data Detective 🕵️‍♀️ Next, you'll put on your detective hat to load and clean the global temperatures dataset with Pandas. We'll get it sparkling clean and ready for action!Create Your Masterpiece 🎨 This is where the magic happens! You will write the app.py script for your Streamlit dashboard. Your creative mission is to add:
A clear title and description.
An interactive slider in the sidebar to let users pick a range of years.
A dynamic line chart that updates on the fly to show temperature trends.
An expandable section to show off the filtered raw data.
Launch Time! 🚀 In the final step, you'll press the launch button! Using ngrok, you will deploy your app and get a live, public URL. You can then show off your amazing work to friends, family, or future employers!
Skills You'll Master 💪

By the end of this project, you'll have successfully:
✅ Combined data cleaning, app development, and visualization into one seamless project.
✅ Built a user-friendly interface with cool Streamlit widgets like sliders and expanders.
✅ Created eye-catching, interactive plots that react instantly to user input.
✅ Understood the basics of deploying a Python web app from the cloud.
Submission Checklist ✅

Follow these two steps to successfully submit your project on Google Classroom.
1. Submit Your Google Colab Notebook 💻

You need to turn in the .ipynb file that contains all your code. You have two options:
Attach the File Directly: On the assignment page, click Add or create, choose Google Drive, and select your notebook file.
Submit a Link: Open your notebook, click the Share button, change the permissions to "Anyone with the link can view," copy the link, and then paste it into the Google Classroom assignment.
2. Provide Proof of a Working Dashboard 📸

This shows that your dashboard is actually live and interactive. Choose one of the following methods to prove it works:
Take Screenshots: Capture a series of screenshots that show your dashboard's key features: the title, the interactive slider, a chart that updates, and the expanded raw data section. You should also include a screenshot of the ngrok output in your Colab notebook, as this shows the public URL.
Record a Video: Create a short screen recording of yourself interacting with the live dashboard. Show yourself moving the slider and watching the charts update in real-time. You can upload this video to a service like Google Drive or YouTube. You can use OBS or any other tool, or you can record using your smartphone.
Important Notes for Proof of Work 📌
For Google Drive: If you upload a video, make sure you set the sharing permissions to "Anyone with the link can view" before you submit it.
For YouTube: When uploading, set the video's visibility to "Unlisted." This lets anyone with the link view it, but it won't be searchable by others. This is a great way to start building a portfolio!
That's it! Once you've attached your notebook and your proof of work, go ahead and click Turn in. Good luck! 🎉This project is your chance to shine and see how your Python skills can create something real, useful, and shareable. We can't wait to see the amazing dashboards you build!
Happy coding! 😊
